# AI Object Detection with COCO-SSD and Next.js

This is a small side project demonstrating real-time object detection using the COCO-SSD model with TensorFlow.js integrated into a Next.js application styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Live Demo

You can find a live demo of this project [here](https://ai-object-detection-omega.vercel.app/). (Replace "#" with your live URL)

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizes the COCO-SSD model to detect objects in real-time through a webcam feed.
- **Next.js Framework**: Built on top of Next.js, providing a powerful and intuitive development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Styled using Tailwind CSS for quick and easy UI development.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow.js**: An open-source library for machine learning in JavaScript, used here for object detection.
- **COCO-SSD Model**: A pre-trained model for object detection available in TensorFlow.js.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    cd <project-folder>
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. **Open your browser**:

    Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you should see a webcam feed. The COCO-SSD model will start detecting objects in real-time. Feel free to interact with the application by placing different objects in front of your webcam.
