# AI Object Detection using TensorFlow COCO-SSD Model

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using TensorFlow's COCO-SSD (Common Objects in Context - Single Shot Multibox Detector) model. The model is capable of detecting and localizing multiple objects in an image with high accuracy and efficiency.
